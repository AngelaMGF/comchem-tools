*Toolkit for Computational Chemistry*

Useful tools to ease Computational Chemistry tasks.

 - You will need to have Python installed to work with these (developed with Python 3.7; also tested in Python 2.7)

# Files

### PDB to CONFIG
Given an input file with `.pdb` extension, converts content into a CONFIG file. Usage:

`./pdb2cfg.py input_file_name`

Where `input_file_name` is the `.pdb` (with or without extension).

It requires an arbitrary number of `.xyz` files in the same folder.
